CarDekho Used Car Price Prediction

This project involves datacleaning and preprocessing the given JSON file, creating exploratory data analysis for cleaned dataset, training the dataset with multiple models, dump & load the better model in pickle file and visualizing the pickle file using Streamlit. 
The datacleaning, eda are performed in a Jupyter Notebook(VS code) and the streamlit visualization(VS Code).

The primary objective of this project is to create a data science solution for predicting used car prices accurately by analyzing a diverse dataset. 
The dataset includes various features such as car model, number of owners, age, mileage, fuel type, kilometers driven, additional features, and location. 
The goal is to build a machine learning model that provides users with accurate predictions for the current valuations of used cars.

This project utilizes the following key technologies and skills:
       1.Python, 2.Numpy, 3.Pandas, 4.Scikit-Learn, 5.Matplotlib, 6.Seaborn, 7.Pickle, 8.Streamlit

Requirements: Python 3.x, Jupyter Notebook(Visual Studio Code) and Streamlit.
